                <!--<p id="aboutmetext">-->Been interested in computers since I was a tiny chubby kid. I would spend hours infront of a pc, 
                    my parents were not about it. So everytime I got in trouble it would put in risk how much time I would spend on the computer.
                    Graduated from Computer Science on  May 2017, so I guess all that "Stop using the computer so much" never really got me.
                    Now I wanna learn web development, so really, I wont be getting away of a computer anytime soon.    
                    <br><br>
                    I ran out of what to say now, and I wanna fill up all this space so text wraps around my picture. I will probably have to
                    write a lot... hopefully not, right? Just a few more words and the text should wrap around the image...
                    Just a little bit more... YASSS, got it! Well, I hope whoever is reading this has a nice day. :)
